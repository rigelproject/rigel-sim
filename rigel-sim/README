Running the build.sh script should run the autotools, configure, and make, leaving you
with a rigelsim binary in ${RIGEL_SIM}/rigel-sim/build/rigelsim.

RigelSim depends on libelf (the version included in the repository), libz,
and libraries produced by building binutils-2.18 in the repository
(libiberty, libbfd, libopcodes).

If you want CouchDB support (RigelSim can dump all simulation results and statistics
into a user-specified CouchDB instance for later analysis), pass --enable-couchdb
to the configure script.  You'll need:
1) libcurlpp, a C++ wrapper around libcurl, for making HTTP requests.
   - Unfortunately, there isn't a package for it in the Ubuntu repos as of 10.10, so
     you'll have to build it from source.
2) libuuid, for generating UUIDs for CouchDB records
3) libcurl
4) libgssapi_krb5, for using CRHC's Kerberos 5-based authentication scheme.

The commands necessary to build the simulator are all in the 'build.sh' shell
script.  You will need aclocal, autoconf, and automake to build the makefiles.
The instructions on how to set up the build environment are in the documentation
directory.
